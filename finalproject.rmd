```{r}
botData <- read.csv("bids.csv")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
trainSet <- read.csv("train.csv")
```

```{r}
trainingFull <- read.csv("training_set_bids.csv")
```


```{r}
unique(botData$auction, incomparables = FALSE)
# 15051 unique auctions
```

```{r}
unique(botData$country,incomparables = FALSE)
# 200 countries
```

```{r}
unique(botData$device, incomparables = FALSE)
# 7351 devices
```

```{r}

# 2303991 ips lulz
```


```{r}

```


```{r}
secTime <- as.POSIXct(Sys.Date())+botData$time/1000000000000000000
botData$secTime <- secTime
```

My questions:

- num of bids (total) per person/bot
- num of total bids per auction
- what auctions the bots liked, and if those auctions had high volume / other characteristic
- what they liked to bid on the most



Do bots participate in the same auctions?
Using the training set, 
- you need labelled data for predictions 
- convert features into user attribute
- the more participants in auctions, the more bots? (finding numbers / run t-test with auctions w/low bots vs. auctions with lots of bots)

num of total bids per auction
```{r}
as.data.frame(table(botData$auction))
```
num of bids (total) per person / bot
```{r}
# num of bids (total) per bidder
as.data.frame(table(trainingFull$bidder_id))
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
trainingFull <- dplyr::left_join(trainingFull,trainSet,by="bidder_id")

```


Do bots typically have a high number of bids?
```{r}
botTrain <- subset(trainingFull, trainingFull$outcome == 1)
as.data.frame(table(botTrain$bidder_id))
# potentially yes!
```

num of bids per person / bot in each auction?
```{r}
# number of bidder ids in each auction
lol <- trainingFull %>% group_by(trainingFull$auction, trainingFull$bidder_id) %>% summarize(count=n())

# number of bot bids in each auction
bot_auction <- botTrain %>% group_by(botTrain$auction, botTrain$bidder_id) %>% summarize(count=n())

# number of unique bots in each auction (i.e. is it just one or two bots in each auction)
uniquebot_auction <- as.data.frame(table(bot_auction$`botTrain$auction`))
max(uniquebot_auction$Freq) #23
mean(uniquebot_auction$Freq) #1.172606
sd(uniquebot_auction$Freq) #1.891
```

```{r}
# number of unique urls per person
url_person <- trainingFull %>% group_by(trainingFull$bidder_id, trainingFull$url) %>% summarize(count=n())
uniqueUrl <- as.data.frame(table(url_person$`trainingFull$bidder_id`))

# number of unique ips per person
ips_person <- trainingFull %>% group_by(trainingFull$bidder_id, trainingFull$ip) %>% summarize(count=n())
uniqueIp <- as.data.frame(table(ips_person$`trainingFull$bidder_id`))

# number of unique address per person
address_person <- trainingFull %>% group_by(trainingFull$bidder_id, trainingFull$address) %>% summarize(count=n())
uniqueAddress <- as.data.frame(table(address_person$`trainingFull$bidder_id`))

# number of unique countries per person
countries_person <- trainingFull %>% group_by(trainingFull$bidder_id, trainingFull$country) %>% summarize(count=n())
uniqueCountry <- as.data.frame(table(countries_person$`trainingFull$bidder_id`))
```
